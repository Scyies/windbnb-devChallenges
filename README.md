<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

Here's my solution and how I got there!

- You can see the demo [here](https://windbnb-liard.vercel.app/)
- I had a fun time building this project, in the end some things like the placement of the search filter on desktop and mobile turned into something more complciated than I first anticipated but in the end everything worked out fine.
- For the most part I did more of the same thing, but I got put into action some different takes to the web site design.
- Unlimited bug works
